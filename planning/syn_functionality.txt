  lgauss A passband with normal distribution in the logarithm of the

COUNTRATE:
Supported:
  - compute the total flux (effective stimulation) in counts
Not yet supported:
- can specify exposure time
- refwave: a specifically called out flux
- flux_tot: total flux through band
- flux_ref: the flux at the reference wavelength

Plband, Plspec: use matplotlib/pylab to directly plot spectra & bandpasses
Genwave: use numpy call to create arrays instead


==No plans to support:==
Fitband, fitgrid, fitspec
