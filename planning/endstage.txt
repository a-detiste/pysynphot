Plan for concluding the syn_pysyn commissioning process:

Goal: apply the information gathered from the syn_pysyn testing to the
ETC regression testing process.

This document assumes the procedure described in the document
pysyn_etc_acceptance_testing.txt, and describes further details in the
"first iteration" of that procedure.

The ordering of subitems in each stage is not necessarily significant;
some items can be worked simultaneously.

PENULTIMATE STAGE:

1. Pysynphot Code Changes
=========================

Commit code changes for remaining set of high-priority tickets:

DONE: (altho extinction curves may need tuning)
  #123: extinction (add new extinction laws, including new
        implementation of the same gal3 law, without turning off old
        gal1/smc/lmc/xgal yet)
  #149: tapering behavior
  #129: etc.countrate() should return effective wavelength

With these tickets, there should be no more test errors.

2. Changes to test definitions
================================
2a. Finish identifying necessary changes to the tests: DONE
    - change Bruzual models to Pickles 
    - change gal2 to gal1 or gal3 
    - remove duplicate cases
2b. Make the changes in the syn_pysyn tests (almost DONE: WFC3 in prog.)
2c. Make the changes in the ETC regression tests
    - requires signoff from instrument teams
    - may require extra work for WFC3

3. Representative subset
========================
3a. Identify the subset of representative test cases 
......(WFC3 in progress, all others DONE)
3b. Modify the test code to include a flag identifying this subset
......DONE
3c. Modify the test assessment tools to generate useful reports of
    only this subset
......In Progress

4. Run the last test set
=========================
4a. Run the tests
4b. Generate Subset report: failed representative tests for scrutiny
4c. Generate Extreme report:failed (nonrep) extreme cases for overview
4d. Generate Countrate report: failed (nonsubset) testcountrate for scrutiny
4e. Generate Throughput report: failed (nonsubset) testthru for scrutiny
4f. Record all accepted failures from the above sets. If necessary,
iterate this step until all failures in the above sets are accepted.


FINAL STAGE:

1. Preparation
==============
1a. Write script to parse ETC logs, extract tast case names, and
    include them in the pysynphot command as another keyword-value
    pair
1b. Write scripts to parse the ETC regression test report logs and
    generate files that contain the name of the failed test, one per
    line. (Two scripts are necessary, one for old-style tests and one
    for new-style tests.)
1c. Write utility to mark syn_pysyn tests as "ETC failed" using the
    above files as input.
1d. Complete changes to the ETC test cases to give them meaningful names.
1e. Modify the ETC code to produce test case names in the log.
1f. Create useful report generator that will use the ETC name to
    generate reports described below

2. Mapping to the ETC cases
=========================== 
2a. Generate the logs of pysynphot calls produced by the ETC regression
    tests that include the name of the ETC regression test
2b. Regenerate the test cases with the ETC name as part of
    the test definition by parsing those logs


3. Run the ETC Regression test set
==================================
3a. Install the latest pysynphot
3b. Disable synphot
3c. Run the regression tests
3d. Generate a report of failed test names

4. Examine any "new" failures
=============================
4a. Subset:    ETC case failed, syn_pysyn accepted failure, 
               subset=True
4b: Extreme:   ETC case failed,syn_pysyn accepted failure, 
               subset=False, Extreme=True
4c: Countrate: ETC case failed, syn_pysyn accepted failure, 
               subset=False, testname contains 'testcountrate'
4d: Throughput:ETC case failed, syn_pysyn accepted failure, 
               subset=False, Extreme=False, testname contains 'testthru'

5. Doublecheck the "expected" failures
=======================================
5a. Subset:    ETC case failed, syn_pysyn passed, subset=True
5b: Extreme:   ETC case failed,syn_pysyn passed, subset=False, Extreme=True
5c: Countrate: ETC case failed, syn_pysyn passed, subset=False,
                 testname contains 'testcountrate'
5d: Throughput:ETC case failed, syn_pysyn passed, subset=False, Extreme=False,
                 testname contains 'testthru'
