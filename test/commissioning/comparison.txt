Writing tests to compare array results from synphot and pysynphot was
difficult. The problem had two elements:

  - produce arrays to be compared on the same waveset
  - devise a comparison that was reasonably insensitive to numerical noise

Producing arrays on the same waveset
-------------------------------------

Because pysynphot was deliberately designed to correct some of synphot's
deficiencies in waveset handling, it is clear that the spectral arrays
produced by the two software packages will be different, unless
special steps are taken to force them onto the same waveset. 

testcrspec:
  This test uses the synphot.countrate task, with a box(15000,30000)
  to simulate the obsmode to produce the source spectrum unconvolved with the
  instrumental obsmode. The task uses a wavecat file to select the
  wavelength table used based on the obsmode. For this test, a special
  purpose wavecat was produced for each run, so that the wavelength
  table in the pysynphot-computed spectrum would be used.

testthru:
  This test samples the pysynphot-computed throughput array on the
  wavelength table used for the synphot-computed throughput.

testcrphotlam:
  For this test, the synphot.countrate task selects its wavelength
  table from the wavecat based on the obsmode, and the pysynphot
  Observation selects its binned wavelength set from the same wavecat
  based on the obsmode. Thus the synphot spectrum can be compared
  directly to the binned tables associated with the pysynphot
  Observation.

testcrcounts:
  For this test, the wavelength table from the synphot-computed
  spectrum is used as the binned wavelength set when constructing
  the pysynphot Observation.
