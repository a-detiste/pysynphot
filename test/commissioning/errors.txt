This file contains an ongoing log of errors encountered by the
syn_pysyn tests.



IRAF errors [real calcspec/countrate difference]
-------------------------------------------------
  ---> renormalization+wavetab has non-overlap for calcspec but not for countrate

IRAF errors [mystery: errors occur in large runs, but not when  
             the case is run individually]
-------------------------------------------------------
IrafError: Error running IRAF task calcphot
IRAF task terminated abnormally
ERROR (502, "floating point invalid operation")

or 

IrafError: Error running IRAF task countrate
IRAF task terminated abnormally
ERROR (2, "Syntax error in expression")


Missing extinction laws: [Known pysyn issue, solution defined]
-----------------------
NotImplementedError: Sorry, gal2 is not yet implemented
  --> replaced all gal2 by gal1 or gal3
NotImplementedError: Sorry, gal3 is not yet implemented

Badly parsed obsmodes with numbers in them: [New; solution not yet defined]
------------------------------------------
TypeError: cannot concatenate 'str' and 'float' objects
  --> This turns out to be a tough problem, given the current
  architecture, because by the time we know we're trying to construct
  a bandpass, the original command provided to the parser is long gone.

Obsmode not supported by graph table: [Known: pysyn stricter than syn]
------------------------------------
ValueError: Warning: unused keywords set(['f25mama'])
  Note: this identified an error in the ETC specification of the obsmode.

Test sw error [no solution w/o writing extra code]:
--------------------------------------
ValueError: too many values to unpack
---> countrate allows 4 params to specify a wavetab; genwave does not,
so cannot use genwave to generate the matching wavetab for calcspec to use.
